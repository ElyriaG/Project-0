# Nice to haves
* Mobile Responsive
* Use an alternative CSS framework like `Materialize`, `Foundation`, `Bulma`

# Presentation
* You will also be responsible for preparing a `10 minute presentation.` This will be a formal presentation. One in which you explain in detail:
* * Your overall application’s concept
* * The motivation for its development
* * Your design process
* * The technologies you used (and briefly how they work) `What challenges did you         have?`
* * A demonstration of its functionality
* * Directions for future development
* * `Treat the presentation seriously!` Talking intelligently about tech is better than actually doing tech sometimes.
